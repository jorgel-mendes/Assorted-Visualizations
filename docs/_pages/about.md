> *Run the Code, Get the Viz, Save the World*

I'm Brazilian undergraduate student that fell in love with data visualization. I started studing R and becoming interested in data science and then with visualization and storytelling. I decided to create this blog to be a channel for sharing my work and to keep track of what I have done and of my progress.

Thus, this blog is a collection of visualizations I made from challenges/studies or small personal projects. Probably gonna also put some insights I got from books or blogs about visualizations, something like "what I learned from this".

I mainly use R so there is going to be a lot of R and ggplot here but I expect some Python or other tools as I keep studying them. Excel is also going to be common, since well we can't deny that excel is common and kind of unavoidable. So I'm trying to use more of its power and want to have a set of examples of what I've done.

Posts will have full code if the data is available/shareable and the code is not too long, in which case I will link to github itself.

An a bit of the blog navigation, if you want to look something for a certain type of visualization, go to tags. If you want to look through a project/theme go to categories.
